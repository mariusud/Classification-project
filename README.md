Classification of Flowers and handwritten numbers, for the course TT4275


## Part 1 - Iris recognizition
For this task, a linear classifier was trained on 30 samples and tested on 20 with focus on design and testing.
Confusion matrix and error rate was found for both train/test sets to compare performance.

### With 30 samples training and 20 for testing we get
correct guesses:  96.66666666666667 %  
Minimum mean-squared error obtained:  0.062082223491377604  
confusion matrix:  
 [[20.  0.  0.  0.]  
 [ 0. 18.  0.  0.]  
 [ 0.  2. 20.  0.]  
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.]]  

### With 30 samples training and 20 for testing we get
correct guesses:  95.0 %  
Minimum mean-squared error obtained:  0.05412946623538162  
confusion matrix:  
 [[20.  1.  0.  0.]  
 [ 0. 19.  2.  0.]
